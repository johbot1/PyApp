# PyApp
One of three Python related projects for my final semester, this one to build a Python Web App
This was one of the hardest projects I've ever done, namely due to never creating a web application before. How everything connected to each other, balancing the HTML with Python and the tiny bit of JavaScript made this a daunting task on it's own. However all of this, coupled with a YouTube tutorial that was 3 years out of date and sometimes just straight up wrong, made this one helluva project to remember. In the end however, I learned alot on how web applications work, both front and back end, and gained a significant appreciation for the sites I visit on a daily basis. One app down, two more to go!
